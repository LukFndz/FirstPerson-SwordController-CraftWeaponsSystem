Unity Crafting & Directional Combat System

A lightweight Unity prototype showcasing two core gameplay systems:

🔨 Crafting System

A simple and extensible item–recipe workflow.
Players can combine items based on predefined recipes to craft new objects.
The system was built to be easy to expand with new items, categories, and crafting rules.

⚔️ Directional Attack System

A melee attack setup where the player can strike left, up, or right depending on their last input direction.
Useful as a base for action RPGs, survival games, or top‑down combat mechanics.
